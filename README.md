# spectroscopy
Program written to analize Raman maps done on Renishaw spectrometer (program reads ONLY Renishaw maps exported to txt or csv). 
To to open file use file->open
To open reference use file->open ref

Next You can use "file->clean up" to remove spikes and noise from spectra
After it You can fit 2D band or H2 band if You have hydrogenated sample

To aply proper substrate subtraction first scale refrence to data by "file->scale ref"
After it subtract substrate and You may fit all carbon bands.
