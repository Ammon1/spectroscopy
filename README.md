# spectroscopy
Program written to analize Raman maps done on Renishaw spectrometer (program reads ONLY Renishaw maps exported to txt or csv). If someone will send me spectra from other spectrometers I'll upgrade program to read it.
To to open file use file->open data
To open reference use file->open reference

Next You can use file->clean data to remove spikes and noise from spectra.

To aply proper substrate subtraction first scale refrence to data by file->scale reference
After it subtract substrate and You may fit all carbon bands. You will obtain maps of FWHM and positions of choosen band.
